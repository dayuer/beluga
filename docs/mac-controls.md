# Mac controls: sizes and where they go

The Mac app's controls follow AppKit's control sizes (`NSControl.ControlSize`), so a sheet, a
Settings row and a toolbar each look like the same control in the same place on a Mac. This page
is the rule; `styles/tokens.css` ("Controls") holds the numbers, and every control reads them from
there, never a height of its own.

## The scale

Three sizes, one per kind of place. Every control of a size shares its height, so a field, a
pop-up and a button on one row line up without adjusting anything.

| Size | Height | Text | Corner | Icon | Padding (button) | Checkbox | Switch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Large** | 28px | 13px | 7px | 16px | 0 16px | 14px | 32 × 19 |
| **Regular** (default) | 22px | 13px | 5px | 14px | 0 12px | 14px | 32 × 19 |
| **Small** | 20px | 12px | 4px | 12px | 0 8px | 12px | 26 × 15 |

- AppKit's mini size (16px, 9pt) is left out: Chinese and Japanese text don't read at that size.
- Small uses 12px text, a point above AppKit's 11pt, for the same reason.
- The heights are the whole control, its bezel included.

| Token | Large | Regular | Small |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| height | `--control-h-large` | `--control-h` | `--control-h-small` |
| text | `--control-text-large` | `--control-text` | `--control-text-small` |
| corner | `--control-radius-large` | `--control-radius` | `--control-radius-small` |

## Which size where

**Regular** is the size of a window's content. Use it unless a rule below says otherwise.

- Sheets and alerts: every field, pop-up and checkbox, and the buttons at the bottom. Those buttons
  are at least 76px wide; the default button is the rightmost one.
- Settings: every row's control (pop-up, field, segmented control, button).
- Forms anywhere: in the inspector, in a popover, on a project's page.
- The segmented control that switches a sheet's or a page's tabs.

**Small** is for controls that sit inside dense content, beside text that is itself small.

- Rows of a list or table: a row's own actions (Merge, Open, Retry).
- Cards (tasks, sentinels, usage), and the header of a card or panel section.
- The right panel's and the dock's own toolbars and switchers (Changes / History, the shells'
  buttons, the dock's Terminal / Background).
- Controls inside a conversation: an answer's actions, a step's buttons, a question's choices.
- Filter bars over a list.

**Large** is for the one thing a screen is for.

- The main action of onboarding, a welcome or an empty state ("Add Project", "Turn On").
- The window's toolbar: its buttons, icon buttons (28 × 28), segmented control and search field.
  This is AppKit's unified toolbar, whose items are 28px tall. The title row goes across the
  window, so the sidebar's buttons there, its search field and the right panel's view switcher
  (Changes / Files / Scratch / Info) are Large too.

Never more than one large button in a view outside the toolbar. One row never mixes sizes.

## Each control

- **Push button** (`Button`, a sheet's or an alert's buttons): plain, primary (the accent, for the
  default action), danger, merge. Height, padding and text by size; at least 76px wide in a sheet's
  or an alert's button row.
- **Icon button** (`IconButton`): square at its size (28 × 28, 22 × 22, 20 × 20), the icon
  16, 14 or 13px and centred, no bezel until hovered or pressed. One without a `size` keeps the
  28 × 26 it had until its screen moves onto the scale (steps 3 and 4).
- **Split button** (a button and its ▾, `SplitButton`, the toolbar's branch button): both halves
  are one control of one size and one bezel; a line inside parts them.
- **Pop-up button** (`Select`): the button's height; the chevrons in an accent box at its end,
  16px square in regular and large, 14px in small.
- **Text field** (`TextInput`, Settings' fields, search fields): the button's height for its size,
  6px padding (8px in large). Code is in the monospaced face a pixel under the system text.
  A text area (`TextArea`) is at least three lines tall and grows.
- **Segmented control** (`Segmented`): the button's height for its size; segments are 2px shorter,
  inside the track's 1px inset.
- **Checkbox** and **switch**: by size, from the table above; the label beside them is the system text.

Keyboard focus is the same everywhere: a 3px accent ring outside the control (`--focus-ring`).

## Chinese and English

The same control has to read well with either language in it (`<html lang>` is `en` or `zh-CN`).

- **Face.** The system face for both: SF for Latin, PingFang SC for Chinese (`--font` names it
  first under `:lang(zh-CN)`, so Han characters never fall to a Japanese face; Microsoft YaHei and
  Noto Sans SC on Windows and Linux). No letter-spacing, no italics, no synthetic bold on Chinese.
- **Size.** No text under 12px, which is why there is no mini size and small text is 12px. A
  control's height is the same in both languages: PingFang's taller glyphs sit centred in it.
- **Width.** Controls with words never get a fixed width: they grow with the label. A sheet's or
  an alert's buttons are at least 76px wide, so a two-character Chinese label (取消, 完成) is as
  big a target as its English one.
- **Labels.** English buttons and menu items are in title case and start with a verb ("New
  Task", "Add Variable"); Chinese ones are a short verb phrase, two to six characters (新建任务,
  添加变量). Form labels have no colon in either language.
- **Punctuation.** An action that asks for more before it acts ends with an ellipsis, the single
  character "…" in both ("Paste Lines…", 粘贴多行…). Chinese text uses full-width punctuation
  (，。：「」), with a space between Chinese and Latin words or numbers (在 Mac 上, 3 个任务).
- **Truncation.** A label too long for its place ends in "…"; a path or branch truncates in the
  middle. Hints and details wrap; Chinese wraps between any two characters, never inside a Latin word.

## Using the sizes

- `Button`, `Select` and `Segmented` take `size`: `'small' | 'regular' | 'large'`, regular by
  default. A screen picks one by the rules above; it doesn't set its own height.
- A screen's own control (a module's `.button`, `.input`…) uses the tokens:
  `height: var(--control-h-small)`, not `height: 20px`.
- A new size is a change to this page first.

## Moving the app onto the scale

Most screens' own controls were sized one by one (about 300 heights between 18px and 34px). They
move in steps, each a PR that changes no behaviour:

1. The shared controls (`components/ui`, `Alert`, `FormSheet`, `Select`, Settings' controls), the
   tokens and the Chinese face. Done with this page.
2. The title row (window toolbar, the sidebar's buttons and search, the panel's view switcher) to
   Large; the right panel's and the dock's own toolbars and tabs to Small. Done.
3. Sheets with their own controls (`dialogs/native/*`, the new-task and new-plan sheets) to Regular:
   their fields, segmented controls and bottom buttons, and a button beside a field. Done; a
   row's own actions in a sheet's list stay Small.
4. Lists, cards and the conversation's own buttons to Small. Done: every `Button`, `IconButton`,
   `Select` and `Segmented` outside Settings, sheets, onboarding, calls and the phone view now names
   its size; the Overview's filter bar and the sentinel page's pickers moved too. Two designs keep
   their own shape on purpose: the composer (its chips and round send button) and the stat pills.
