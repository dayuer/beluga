# Antigravity

Beluga can run [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) as your agent, beside Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot and local models. It runs the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) you have installed, signed in with your own Google account, on the models your Antigravity plan has: Gemini, and the Claude and GPT-OSS models Antigravity offers.

## Set it up

1. Install the Antigravity CLI: `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash` (it puts `agy` in `~/.local/bin`). Version 1.5 or newer: an older `agy` has no ACP server (`agy update`).
2. Sign in once in Terminal: run `agy`, and it opens Google's sign-in in your browser.
3. Open **Settings › Agent** (or the "Your agents" step when you first open Beluga). Antigravity shows **Ready** once Beluga finds it signed in. **Sign In** beside it starts `agy` in Terminal for you, and **Check Again** looks again.

Make it yours with the radio button, or pick it for one conversation in the agent picker above the message box.

`BELUGA_AGY_PATH` points Beluga at another `agy`.

## Models

Antigravity is listed with the models your plan has, as `agy models` shows them. Gemini takes a thinking level (Low, Medium, High), picked as its effort. If your plan doesn't have a model you picked, the conversation runs on Antigravity's own model and says so in a line.

A model Google retires leaves the list on its own: Beluga asks Antigravity each time.

## What works

- Worktrees and chats, with steps on the card as they happen: commands, reads, writes, edits, searches, and Beluga's own tools.
- Approvals: Antigravity asks before each command, write and MCP tool, and Beluga asks you when Claude would.
- **Plan** first, then approve: Antigravity's own Plan mode, and Beluga turns its writes down until you approve.
- **Stop**, and **Steer Now**, which stops the turn and answers your message next. Antigravity takes one message at a time, so a message you send while it works waits for its turn.
- **Compact**, picking up a conversation later, and handing a conversation to another agent.
- Pictures in a message.
- Beluga's instructions go into Antigravity's own system prompt, so your rules and its own stay as they are.
- Usage: tokens for each turn, and the context meter.

## What's different

- **Reads without asking.** Antigravity reads files (`.env` files too) without asking first, and its own permission rules don't reach reads from Beluga. See [security](security.md#antigravity-runs).
- **Friends' tasks go to Claude or Codex.** Because it doesn't ask before every step, a task a friend sends you runs on Claude (or Codex) when one is set up here, and their card says so.
- **No guests.** A guest you invite into a project can't prompt Antigravity: switch that conversation to Claude for them.
- **No Fork, no /btw.** Antigravity can't branch a conversation, so a fork starts a fresh one (the files come along), and editing a sent message starts afresh from your edited message.
- **No Terminal view.** Antigravity conversations stay in the chat.
- **Questions mid-run**: Antigravity asks in its answer, and you reply in the box.
- **A declined step.** Antigravity ends its turn without a word when a step is turned down, so Beluga tells it why, once, and it answers.
- **Gemini looks around a lot.** On Gemini 3.8 Flash, Antigravity often reads and searches well past what you asked (other folders, your home folder) before it answers. Its commands still come to you, but a Claude model on your plan keeps closer to the request.
- **Your plan's quota.** Every message uses some of your Antigravity quota, and so do Beluga's small asks when Antigravity is your agent (naming a worktree, drafting a task). When it runs out, the card says so; `agy` then `/usage` in Terminal shows what's left.
- **Your MCP servers**: the ones in your Antigravity config run in its conversations, as they do in Antigravity. Settings › MCP lists Claude Code's and Codex's.
- **Deleting a chat** deletes Antigravity's own record of it too (its conversation file and notes in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`).

## Checking it

`npx vitest run tests/antigravity-flow.test.ts` runs it against a scripted `agy acp` in the shapes the Antigravity CLI 1.5.8 sends. `npx tsx scripts/live-antigravity.ts` runs the same checks against your real `agy` (about 15 messages of your quota).
