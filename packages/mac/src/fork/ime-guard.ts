/**
 * Fork (BLG-118, BLG-187): Enter that picks an input method's words (Chinese, Japanese, Korean…),
 * and Tab, Escape and the arrows pressed while it composes (they move through its candidates), never
 * reach the app's own key handlers, so no box sends, submits, closes, completes or moves on them, as
 * each box's own check did before (IME_KEYS; letters are left alone, so shortcuts are too). One place
 * instead of a check in every box: a keydown listener on the window, capture phase, installed in
 * main.tsx before anything else listens. It runs before React (whose listeners sit on the root)
 * and before every other window listener (dictation's ↩, the sheets'), and only stops the event's
 * propagation: never preventDefault, which would also drop the characters the IME is committing.
 *
 * Left alone: the terminal (xterm reads keyCode 229 itself to pick up what the IME typed). The IME
 * itself never sees the difference: it handles its keys before the page does.
